Forged in Fire is one of the best things on TV right now. Hands-down.
It's also a fantastic example of professional behavior, and the
professional process. Young professionals like myself stand to
learn quite a bit from it. In this article, I'm going to explain
the what and the why.

First, though, let's get in an overview of Forged in Fire. It's a game show
wherin four contestents compete for $10,000 by forging knives out of
various materials that are then abused and tested in a varity of ways.

Yeah, that's basically it.

The structure of the show is... well, if you judge it purely by
the standards of other 'reality shows', then its downright boring.
The structure is identical between episodes. Everyone is professional
and polite. The opinions of the judges are well-reasoned. The set is
industrial, the lighting is utilitarian, and about the only traditionay
'exciting' parts are when the judges are violently testing the knives.

Dispite this, the show itself is absolutely fascinating. There *is* drama,
but it arises naturally from watching two people *actually* compete. Like
I said, everyone is professional and polite, to the point where every single
eliminated contestent agrees with the judges, and many help each other
during the first phase of competition.

Simple, no? Each episode follows the same format- Four contestents
enter, the MC (Wil Willis) explains the constraints under which
they'll be forging, the parameters their knives will need to meet,
and the 'challenges' their knives will be subjected to. One contestent
is eliminated after the raw blades are constructed. One is sent packing
after the knives are run through a gauntlet designed to stress test them.
The two remaining smiths are sent to their own forges to recreate a
historical weapon, which is then subjected to its own round of stress
tests. The winner walks away with $10,000 and an invitation to the season
fanale.
