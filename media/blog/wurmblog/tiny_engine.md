# Making a teeny-tiny engine

For the past few months, I have been insane.  Demented. Mad!

I've been making a general-purpose game engine for js13k.

For those who aren't familiar with it, [js13k](https://2018.js13kgames.com/) is a competition where crazy people make
incredibly small games in nothing but JavaScript/HTML/CSS.
By "incredibly small", I'm not talking of what today seems small. I mean so small that it would be considered
restrictive in the NES era. I mean so small that the picture of your cat
you took on your phone is several orders of magitude larger. I mean so small
that the maximum size of all of the games ever submitted in the history of the competition 
(all 1,075 of them!) is 14 megabytes! That's just ***ten*** (10!!!) 
1986 3.5" floppys! That's 6 copies of the original shareware doom! That's [half the size of an average iOS app!](https://sweetpricing.com/blog/2017/02/average-app-file-size/)

I mean omg guys 13 kilobytes is *tiny*!

Obviously, that's what makes it a good challenge.
